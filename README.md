The current fee payment system in our college involves skipping class and standing in long queues. This process is tiresome as well as time consuming. Our project tries to make life easier for students in paying their fees by providing an Online Platform to do so.Here we present the various functionalities of our Online Fee Payment System CETPay

## Stacks Used

The whole application is build on the following : 

 - `Reactjs`  front-end
 - `MySQL` database
 - `Nodejs - Express` back-end
 - `Stripe` payment medium


## Basic concept

Lets now familiarize CETPay a bit more clearly. 
There are two types of Logins :

 - ***Student*** : aka our main user, for whom the product will be more useful. They can 
	 - login 
	 - reset their password
	 - pay their fee
	 - get the receipt
 - ***Admin*** :  is also a user who can 
	 - login
	 - will have an admin dashboard
	 - see the students and their status
	 - filter them out 
	 - can pay student's fee offline
	 - can reset student's and their own password
	 - Add student

	 - The major reason we have used Stripe for the project is that it provides a test mode.
	- On Successful Payment, the payment receipt is sent to the email provided by the student at the time of
payment.
